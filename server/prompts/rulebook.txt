Rulebook for construction takeoff:

1. Always use the scale and dimensions shown on the plans. Do not estimate scale.
2. Count each item once; avoid double-counting across sheets or details.
3. Apply waste factors only when standard for the trade (e.g. lumber, drywall) and note them.
4. Use the units specified on the plans (LF, SF, CY, EA, etc.).
5. When in doubt, round quantities per trade custom (e.g. lumber in whole pieces, concrete in quarter yards).
6. Note any assumptions (e.g. "assumes 8' ceiling") in the line item or notes field.
